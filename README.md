# Ana's SQL Portfolio for Data Analysis

Hi, welcome to my little space here! This repository houses examples of SQL I've written for SQL challenges where I practice my SQL knowledge, as well as SQL I've written for solo data analysis projects.

## SQL-Related Projects and Challenges
<li>
  <b> <a href = https://github.com/datawithana/SQL-portfolio/blob/347ca505cd97bcb50556261cd422dc29d1a55597/Elementary%20School%20Teacher%20Database>Elemetary School's Teacher Database </a> </b>- In this project, I first created an elementary school's teacher database and use MySQL as my RDMS to showcase my understanding of databases and database designs. I then wrote SQL queries to perform calculations, manipulate data and implement pattern matching in queries for precise data retrieval from the said database.

  <b> Superstore Sales Analysis </b>- I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze the trends of the given mock-up company.

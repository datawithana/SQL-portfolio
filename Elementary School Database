-- Hello! I compiled here examples of SQL codes and queries I written after completing freeCodeCamp.org's SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners
-- Course Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=14074
-- Course Length: 4 hours and 20 minutes

-- Overview: In this exercise, I created an elementary's school database for its teachers.
-- Data Population: I used tools and sites like Mackaroo, ChatGPT and MS Excel to generate dummy data and populate tables. Names and other details are randomly selected and don't represent any specific individuals.
